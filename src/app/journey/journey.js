    description:
      "Starting off my journey, I began by learning the fundamentals of programming in Java by building a simple connect four game. Afterwards, I learned about set theory, graphs and spanning trees in discrete math. Then, I studied the different parts of data structures by employing arrays, hash tables, linked lists, queues and stacks, graphs, and binary trees. In addition, I implied the theory of binary search, merge sort, and breadth first search in algorithm analysis. I then took Computer Organization and Architecture, where we learned about parity bits and logic gates. Next, in Database Systems I got to experiment with MySQL Workbench in creating sample queries by learning how to insert and remove items from a table. Then, in intro to Software Engineering I learned about the different project management methodologies including the waterfall model and agile method. Afterwards, in Operating Systems, we developed a sample linux kernel by installing ubuntu on virtualbox and designing a linux kernel. Next, I took Concepts of Programming Languages where I understood the differences between a scanner, parser and an interpreter. Similarly, in Software Testing and Quality Assurance I took the same principles and applied unit testing for both program-based and specification-based testing. I then took user interface, where we learned how to apply the theory of generating efficient user interfaces and designs when showcasing a product. I decided to take internet programming as an elective, due to it being an interest learning about how the web interacts with api(s), client and server connections, etc. Consequently, I enrolled in Artificial Intelligence, where I got to experiment with TensorFlow and K-Means Clustering. Eventually, I entered machine vision, where I did research on facial recognition and object detection techniques by building a smart checkout system capable of detecting individual items in a cart and identifying a users face. Lastly, I took Senior Project, where I got to work with IoT devices including a raspberry pi, adafruit motor hat library and pi audio suite in successfully implementing an autonomous sentry gun.",
